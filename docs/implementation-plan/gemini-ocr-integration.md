## 5. Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

*   Task 1 complete. User has created and populated the `.env` file.
*   Task 2 complete: User has provided the Gemini API Key and confirmed GCP project configuration.
*   Task 3 (Backend Proxy Server) complete. Server starts successfully with `npm run start:server`.
*   Task 4 (Frontend React Component - Initial UI and File Upload) complete. Component created at `src/components/ocr/GolfScorecardOcrFeature.tsx` with full file upload functionality, image preview, client-side validation, and integration with backend proxy. Test route added at `/ocr`. Commit: 5ee64a8.
*   **Task 5 (Enhance OCR Prompt Engineering) - COMPLETE**: Enhanced the OCR prompt with specific golf scorecard recognition instructions. The prompt now includes detailed guidance for extracting course name, date, hole details (number, par, stroke index, yardage), and player information. Added clear JSON structure expectations and guidance for handling visible vs unclear information. Backend API tested and working correctly. Commit: 7802135.
*   **Task 6 (Add Data Validation and Parsing for Extracted JSON) - COMPLETE**: Implemented comprehensive data validation and parsing system with TypeScript interfaces, error/warning handling, structured data normalization, summary statistics, and enhanced UI display. The system now validates OCR responses, handles Gemini API format, checks golf-specific constraints, and provides user-friendly presentation of extracted data. All tests passing. Commit: 204cede.
*   **Task 7 (Integrate with Existing Course Management System) - COMPLETE**: Implemented comprehensive course integration functionality. Added course matching algorithm with exact/partial/location-based matching, course creation from OCR data with proper data structure mapping, UI for course selection and new course creation, integration with millbrookDb for course storage and retrieval, auto-selection of exact matches for improved UX. The system now connects OCR extracted courses with existing course database, allows creating new courses from scorecard data, and provides seamless workflow for course management integration. All tests passing. Commit: 7041d64.
*   **Task 8 (Add User Feedback and Correction Capabilities) - COMPLETE**: Implemented comprehensive user feedback and correction system. Added edit mode toggle with save/cancel functionality, editable course information (name, date), editable hole data with add/remove capabilities, editable player information and scores, real-time validation and unsaved changes warning, UI controls for managing holes and players in edit mode, integration with existing course matching system. Users can now manually correct OCR errors and refine extracted data before finalizing course integration. All functionality working correctly. Commit: 0ece394.
*   **Ready for Task 9**: Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms
