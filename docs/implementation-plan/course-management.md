# Course Management Feature Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Millbrook Game Scorekeeper currently has a single hardcoded course (Millbrook Golf & Tennis Club). Users need the ability to add and manage multiple courses to use the app at different golf courses. This feature will enable:

1. **Course Database**: Expand from single hardcoded course to multiple courses
2. **Multiple Import Methods**: Support various ways to add courses (API/web scraping, manual entry, photo OCR)
3. **Course Persistence**: Store courses in IndexedDB for offline access
4. **Course Selection**: Allow users to select course during game setup

The implementation will be phased, with photo/OCR import as the final feature to add.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges

1. **Data Sources Variability**: Different golf course data sources have varying formats and completeness
2. **Validation Complexity**: Golf course data needs comprehensive validation (18 holes, valid pars, stroke indexes, etc.)
3. **User Experience**: Import process should be intuitive with clear error messages and warnings
4. **Performance**: Large course databases need efficient search and filtering
5. **Data Quality**: Imported data may be incomplete or incorrect, requiring sanitization

### Implementation Strategy

- **Phase 1**: Foundation (database layer, validation, formats) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Phase 2**: Manual course entry UI
- **Phase 3**: API/web scraping integration  
- **Phase 4**: Photo OCR import

#### Task 2.2: Course Editing Interface
- Edit existing course information
- Modify tee options and hole data
- Bulk operations for hole data
- Import/export individual courses

**Success Criteria**: Full course editing capabilities

### Phase 3: API/Web Scraping Integration

#### Task 3.1: Golf Course API Integration
- Research and integrate with golf course APIs (Golf Genius, USGA, etc.)
- Implement API data transformation to internal format
- Add API rate limiting and error handling
- Cache API responses

**Success Criteria**: Courses can be imported from external APIs

#### Task 3.2: Web Scraping Implementation
- Implement web scraping for popular golf course websites
- Add data extraction and cleaning logic
- Handle different website structures
- Respect robots.txt and rate limits

**Success Criteria**: Courses can be scraped from golf course websites

### Phase 4: Photo OCR Import

#### Task 4.1: Scorecard Photo Processing
- Implement photo capture/upload interface
- Integrate OCR library for text extraction
- Add image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy
- Parse extracted text into course data

**Success Criteria**: Users can photograph scorecards to import course data

#### Task 4.2: OCR Data Validation and Correction
- Implement confidence scoring for OCR results
- Add manual correction interface for uncertain data
- Provide visual feedback on extraction quality
- Allow partial imports with manual completion

**Success Criteria**: OCR imports are accurate and user-correctable
