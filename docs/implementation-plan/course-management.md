# Course Management Feature Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The Millbrook Game Scorekeeper currently has a single hardcoded course (Millbrook Golf & Tennis Club). Users need the ability to add and manage multiple courses to use the app at different golf courses. This feature will enable:

1. **Course Database**: Expand from single hardcoded course to multiple courses
2. **Multiple Import Methods**: Support various ways to add courses (API/web scraping, manual entry, photo OCR)
3. **Course Persistence**: Store courses in IndexedDB for offline access
4. **Course Selection**: Allow users to select course during game setup

The implementation will be phased, with photo/OCR import as the final feature to add.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges

1. **Data Sources Variability**: Different golf course data sources have varying formats and completeness
2. **Validation Complexity**: Golf course data needs comprehensive validation (18 holes, valid pars, stroke indexes, etc.)
3. **User Experience**: Import process should be intuitive with clear error messages and warnings
4. **Performance**: Large course databases need efficient search and filtering
5. **Data Quality**: Imported data may be incomplete or incorrect, requiring sanitization

### OCR/Photo Import Analysis (Planner Mode - [2025-01-04])

After analyzing both API integration and web scraping approaches, the most viable solution is **OCR-based photo import** for golf scorecard recognition. Here's my comprehensive analysis:

#### Why OCR/Photo Import is the Best Approach:

**1. User-Friendly & Practical**
- Golfers already have scorecards from courses they play
- Simple workflow: take photo → extract data → validate → save
- No dependency on external APIs or scraping targets
- Works offline (client-side OCR processing)

**2. Cost-Effective & Free**
- **Tesseract.js**: Completely free, runs in browser, 100+ languages
- No API costs or rate limiting concerns
- Self-contained solution without external dependencies

**3. Technical Feasibility**
- Excellent existing projects prove this works:
  - `tdvtoan/scorecard-recognition`: Golf scorecard OCR with OpenCV/Flask
  - `joshshep/golfr`: Golf scorecard processing with OpenCV and Keras
- Browser-based OCR with Tesseract.js is mature and reliable
- Scorecard layouts are structured and OCR-friendly

**4. OCR Accuracy for Golf Scorecards**
- Scorecards have high-contrast printed text (course info, hole numbers, pars)
- Structured tabular layout helps with data extraction
- Handwritten scores can be handled with reasonable accuracy
- Post-processing validation can catch most errors

#### Rejected Alternatives:

**API Integration Issues:**
- Limited free options with adequate course databases
- Golf API services are expensive ($0.01-0.10 per request)
- Incomplete data coverage for smaller/local courses
- Complex authentication and rate limiting

**Web Scraping Issues:**
- Legal risks (robots.txt violations, ToS violations)
- Anti-bot measures make it unreliable
- Maintenance overhead as sites change
- Rate limiting and IP blocking concerns
- Complex infrastructure requirements (proxies, CAPTCHA handling)

#### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 3: OCR/Photo Import System**
- Use **Tesseract.js** for client-side OCR processing
- Implement image preprocessing for better accuracy
- Build structured data extraction for scorecard layouts
- Add validation and manual correction interface

## Lessons Learned

### Task 3.2: Structured Scorecard Data Extraction - [2025-01-04]
- **Pattern Matching Complexity**: Golf scorecard formats vary significantly, requiring multiple pattern matching strategies for robust extraction
- **State Abbreviation Validation**: Using word boundaries (`\b`) in regex patterns is crucial to avoid false matches (e.g., "Links" containing "IN")
- **Location Extraction Strategy**: Prioritizing standalone location lines over embedded patterns improves accuracy for separate-line formats
- **Confidence Scoring**: Penalizing minimal data extraction is essential for realistic confidence assessment in OCR results
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage (25 tests) was crucial for identifying and fixing edge cases during implementation
- **Data Validation Importance**: Providing both errors and warnings helps users understand data quality issues without blocking valid imports
