# Ghost Player User Guide

## What are Ghost Players?

Ghost Players are synthetic players that allow you to start a Millbrook game with fewer than 4 real golfers. When your usual foursome is missing players, Ghost Players fill in to maintain the traditional Millbrook format while keeping the competition fair and exciting.

## When to Use Ghost Players

- **Solo Practice**: Play by yourself with 3 ghosts
- **Duo Games**: Play with a friend and 2 ghosts  
- **Trio Rounds**: Play with 2 friends and 1 ghost
- **Maintaining Format**: Keep the traditional 4-player team format regardless of attendance

## How Ghost Players Work

### Realistic Performance
Ghost players are based on real players from your roster. Each ghost:
- Uses the handicap index of the selected player
- Generates realistic scores that match that player's skill level
- Participates in all side bets, junk calculations, and team scoring
- **Does NOT count** toward Big Game statistics (following traditional rules)

### Score Generation
Ghost scores are statistically generated to match realistic golf performance:
- **Distribution**: Scores follow proper handicap system expectations
- **Consistency**: Ghost players have good and bad rounds just like real golfers
- **Junk Events**: Ghosts can achieve birdies, sandies, greenies, and other special events

### Suspense and Engagement
Ghost scores are hidden by default during play to maintain excitement:
- **Hidden by Default**: You won't see ghost scores until you choose to reveal them
- **On-Demand Reveals**: Tap the reveal button to see each ghost's score
- **Dynamic Narratives**: Each reveal includes a story about how the shot played out
- **Strategic Timing**: Choose when to reveal based on your own performance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do ghost players count toward Big Game?
**A:** No. Following traditional Millbrook rules, ghost players are excluded from Big Game calculations. The Big Game uses only the best 2 net scores from real players.

### Q: Can I have more than one ghost player?
**A:** Yes! You can have 1, 2, or even 3 ghost players in a single round. The app supports any combination of real and ghost players up to the 4-player total.

### Q: Are ghost scores random?
**A:** No. Ghost scores are statistically generated based on the selected player's handicap index and follow realistic golf scoring patterns. They're not random but rather model realistic golf performance.

### Q: Can I reveal all ghost scores at once?
**A:** Yes. Each ghost player has a "Reveal All" option that shows scores for all 18 holes at once if you prefer not to reveal hole-by-hole.

### Q: Do ghost junk events count toward payouts?
**A:** Yes. Ghost players can achieve birdies, sandies, greenies, and other junk events, and these count toward team junk payouts just like real players.

### Q: What happens if I close the app during a round with ghosts?
**A:** Your reveal state is saved. When you reopen the app, ghost scores will still be hidden/revealed exactly as you left them.

### Q: Can the same real player be used as a base for multiple ghosts?
**A:** No. Each ghost must be based on a different real player from your roster. This ensures variety in ghost performance and prevents conflicts.

### Q: Do ghost players affect my personal statistics?
**A:** No. Ghost players are separate entities and don't affect your personal golf statistics or handicap tracking.
